# 07th Mod Bot

## Installation

1. You must have the following dependencies installed:
    - node.js (this will install npm)
2. Clone this git repository
3. Run `npm install`
4. Obtain a discord bot token (TODO: add instructions for this)
5. Save the token in a file called `token.token`, with nothing else in the file
6. Run `npm start` to run the bot

## IDE setup

1. ESlint is used for linting
2. Install the eslint plugin for Visual Studio Code
3. Open the respository **folder** (not just the source file), and Visual Studio Code should add linting.
